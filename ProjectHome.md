# Simple Sudoku #

I was curious about how you might go about writing a program to solve a Soduku puzzle. I don’t know about anyone else, but this is how I would do it!

Purely as an exercise I wrote this minimalist application during one week last summer. I did so without internet access using the power only of my own brain- just for fun! I’m sure my solution is neither the most efficient (definately not) nor the most elegant. But it is mine- and I understand it!

The compiled application and VC++ source code are available to download for your curiosity.

Thanks for looking, Neil!
